                    Indicator 2 seeks to assess the extent to which governments and development partners contribute to an enabling environment
                    for civil society organisations (CSOs), in addition to how CSOs are implementing development effectiveness
                    principles in their own operations. This indicator provides a useful tool to spark multi-stakeholder
                    dialogue among governments, CSOs and development partners at the country level. It also helps identify
                    progress and room for improvement in creating a CSO enabling environment and furthering CSOs’ own development
                    effectiveness.
                    <br>
                    <br> This indicator was measured for the first time as part of the 2016 monitoring round. Data was sourced
                    through a qualitative questionnaire, answers to which were agreed through a country-level multi-stakeholder
                    dialogue process led by the government, and engaging CSOs, development partner, and other relevant stakeholders.
                    <br>
                    <br> The questionnaire contains four modules with questions on: Government support for multi-stakeholder
                    dialogue around national development policies (Module 1);
                    <ul>
                      <li>CSO accountability and transparency (Module 2); </li>
                      <li>Official development co-operation with CSOs (Module 3); and </li>
                      <li>The legal and regulatory environment where CSOs operate (Module 4). </li>

                    Indicator 3 assesses the engagement of the private sector and the quality of public-private dialogue (PPD) in a given country.
                    In doing so, it recognises the importance of inclusive dialogue with the private sector for building
                    a policy environment conducive to growth and sustainable development.
                    <br>
                    <br> The indicator builds on tools developed by the World Bank, and its three modules combine globally-sourced
                    quantitative scores and country-sourced qualitative information compiled through a multi-stakeholder
                    dialogue process.
                    <br>
                    <br> The indicator is structured around the three following modules:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Module 1 assesses the country’s enabling environment for engagement with the private sector and relies
                        on globally-sourced data. The results for this module draw on country scores from a series of international
                        indices, including the ‘Public Engagement’ index from the Open Budget Survey, as well as the ‘Voice
                        and Accountability’, ‘Rule of Law’ and ‘Control of Corruption’ indices from the Worldwide Governance
                        Indicators and the ‘Citizen Engagement in Rulemaking’ index.</li>
                      <li>Module 2 assesses the country’s readiness for public-private dialogue. It relies on a qualitative questionnaire,
                        answers to which were agreed through a country-level multi-stakeholder dialogue process led by the
                        government, and engaging focal points from the private sector, development partners, trade unions,
                        CSOs and other relevant stakeholders; </li>
                      <li>Module 3 is designed as an optional component, and provides an in-depth assessment (case study) of
                        the quality and organisational effectiveness of a given public-private platform in the country.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The results displayed for this indicator (Module 2 only) are on a scale from 0 (weak) to 10 (strong). This indicator was
                    measured for the first time as part of the 2016 monitoring round.

                    Indicator 4 seeks to capture the timeliness, comprehensiveness and forward-looking nature of individual development partners’
                    electronic publication of information on co-operation resources. It measures transparency by considering
                    three complementary measurements in parallel: the OECD-DAC’s
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/idsonline.htm">Creditor Reporting System</a> (CRS) and
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/idsonline.htm">Forward-Spending Survey</a> (FSS); and the
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/index.html">International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br> The
                    <a href="http://www.oecd.org/development/effectiveness/49650173.pdf">Busan Partnership Agreement</a> mandated a ‘common standard’ for transparency, which was to be built
                    on the three measurements. Following joint technical work between these bodies, however, it was clear
                    that it was not possible to develop a singular common standard to assess transparency because the three
                    measurements are designed to meet the needs of different audiences and are therefore not directly comparable
                    in assessing development partners’ reporting performance.
                    <br>
                    <br> To facilitate interpretation of the overall scores for these three transparency assessments, development
                    partners are categorised on the same four-tiered scale: Excellent, Good, Fair and Needs Improvement.
                    Nonetheless, each of the assessments has its own distinct
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://effectivecooperation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3.-Global-Partnership-Transparency-Indicator-Methodological-Note.pdf">underlying methodology</a>, and therefore they are not directly comparable among themselves.

                    Indicator 5a measures whether development co-operation flows are becoming more predictable over time, focusing on annual
                    predictability of development co-operation. In doing so, it recognises that shortfalls in the total amount of funding
                    for the government sector and delays in the in-year disbursements of scheduled funds can have serious implications for
                    a government’s ability to implement development policies and strategies as planned.
                    <br>
                    <br> The percentage result displayed for this indicator corresponds to the share of development co-operation funding that
                    is disbursed to the government within the fiscal year for which it was scheduled by the development partner. It captures
                    both the reliability of development partners in delivering the promised resources within the relevant year and their
                    capacity to accurately forecast and disburse this funding (i.e. implement their development co-operation activities)
                    within a 12-month period.

                    for a government’s ability to plan and implement policies and strategies, deliver public services and design and conduct
                    sound macro-economic policy.

                    <br> This indicator measures the estimated share of development co-operation funding covered by indicative forward expenditure
                    or implementation plans shared with government. Such plans must cover all known components of the development partner’s

                    Indicator 7 seeks to measure progress made by developing countries in undertaking mutual assessment reviews with their development
                    partners. The principle of mutual accountability recognises that development impacts improve when all parties
                    take responsibility for their contributions.
                    <br>
                    <br> A country is considered to have a mutual assessment in place when at least four of the following five criteria
                    have been met:
                    <ul>
                      <li>An aid or partnership policy is in place that defines the country’s development co-operation priorities;</li>
                      <li>Country-level targets (for both the country and its development partners) have been established;</li>
                      <li>Government and development partners conduct regular joint assessment towards these targets at least every
                        two years;</li>

                    This indicator seeks to measure government efforts to track and make public resource allocations for gender equality and
                    women’s empowerment. It does so by encouraging national governments to develop appropriate budget tracking
                    and monitoring systems and commit to making information about allocations for gender equality readily accessible
                    to the public.
                    <br>
                    <br> Tracking budget allocations with a gender perspective makes it possible to apply a gender lens to development

                    <br>
                    <br> For the purpose of measuring this indicator, a country is considered to have a system in place to track

                    <ul>
                      <li>The country has an official government statement for tracking budget allocations for gender equality and

                      <li>Allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment are systematically tracked through an officially

                      <li>Leadership and oversight of the tracking system is carried out by the central government unit in charge
                        of public expenditure; and</li>

                    Indicator 9a seeks to assess progressive strengthening of a country’s own systems. Well-performing country systems are essential
                    to ensure that public expenditure for ambitious national plans translates into development results in the most
                    effective and sustainable manner.
                    <br>
                    <br> This indicator measures the proportion of participating countries moving up by at least half a point on the
                    World Bank’s Quality of Budgetary and Financial Management Scale. It is based on the scores for the quality
                    of budgetary and financial management of the World Bank’s
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/CPIA">Country Policy and Institutional Assessment</a> (CPIA).
                    <br>
                    <br> Scores range from 1-6 in half-point increments; the higher the score, the more reliable the country’s budget
                    and financial management system is considered to be.
                    <br>
                    <br> The CPIA assesses whether the country meets the following three criteria, which are equally weighted:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Existence of a comprehensive and credible budget, linked to policy priorities;</li>
                      <li>Effective financial management systems to ensure that the budget is implemented as intended in a controlled
                        and predictable way; and</li>
                      <li>Timely and accurate accounting and financial reporting, including audited public accounts and effective arrangements
                        for follow-up.</li>
                    </ul>
                    For the 2016 monitoring round, the Global Partnership monitoring framework drew on the most recent CPIA scores (2015). For
                    the 2014 monitoring round, CPIA scores from 2012 were used.

                    of the development partner – for budget execution, financial reporting, auditing and procurement of goods and

                    Indicator 10 measures the share of development assistance that is fully untied within a given country or by a development
                    partner. Tied aid implies funding for which partners establish geographical restrictions as to where funds
                    can be spent.
                    <br>
                    <br> Tying funding decreases the effective use of the funds and reduces the value-for-money of development co-operation.
                    Tied aid also challenges the country’s ownership over purchasing decisions and deprives the country of potential
                    positive externalities in using development co-operation, such as using local suppliers.
                    <br>
                    <br> Aid is considered untied when the bilateral partner does not impose geographical restrictions on the use of

                    This dimension of Indicator 8 assesses whether there exists an official government statement on a system for tracking allocations
                    for gender equality and women’s empowerment (yes / no).
                    <br>
                    <br> It is one of three institutional conditions for gender equality and women’s empowerment, one of which must
                    be met in order for the country to be considered as having a system in place to track gender allocations
                    for the purposes of Global Partnership monitoring.
                    <br>
                    <br> For this purpose, the official government statement is defined as a process or procedure in place to plan,
                    approve, allocate and monitor public expenditures at the national and sectoral level in a way that ensures
                    that expenditures are targeted appropriately to benefit both women and men. Such systems can include gender
                    budget statements, classifiers, gender markers and even preliminary guidelines. The system in place is overseen
                    by a governmental body, in most cases the Ministry of Finance, that considers gender impact in budget decisions
                    and incorporates measures to mitigate any adverse impact on gender equality and women’s empowerment.

                    This dimension of Indicator 8 assesses whether allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment are systematically
                    tracked (yes / no).
                    <br>
                    <br> It is one of three institutional conditions for gender equality and women’s empowerment, one of which must
                    be met in order for the country to be considered as having a system in place to track gender allocations
                    for the purposes of Global Partnership monitoring.
                    <br>
                    <br> Allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment can be defined as:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Resources allocated at sector and local level for programmes that specifically target only women or girls;
                        </li>
                      <li>Resources allocated at sector and local level to actions that target both women and men equally, but in
                        which gender equality is a specific objective; and</li>
                      <li>Resources allocated at sector and local level to actions where gender is mainstreamed. For example, an
                        infrastructure project that doesn’t include gender equality as an explicit objective but includes women
                        as beneficiaries.</li>
                    </ul>
                    ‘Systematically tracked’ means that a tracking process is planned and regularly conducted. For instance, if the tracking
                    of budgets allocations towards gender equality is officially planned and conducted annually by an identifiable
                    or designated body, it can be said that allocations for gender equality are systematically tracked.
