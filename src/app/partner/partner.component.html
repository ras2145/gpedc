                                        Indicator 2 seeks to assess the extent to which governments and development partners contribute to an enabling environment for civil society organisations (CSOs), in addition to how CSOs are implementing development effectiveness principles in their own
                                        operations. This indicator provides a useful tool to spark multi-stakeholder dialogue among governments, CSOs and development partners at the country level. It also helps identify progress and room for improvement
                                        in creating a CSO enabling environment and furthering CSOs’ own development effectiveness. <br><br> This indicator was measured for the first time as part of the 2016 monitoring
                                        round. Data was sourced through a qualitative questionnaire, answers to which were agreed through a country-level multi-stakeholder dialogue process led by the government, and engaging CSOs, development partner,
                                        and other relevant stakeholders.<br><br> The questionnaire contains four modules with questions on: Government support for multi-stakeholder dialogue around national development policies (Module 1);

                                        Indicator 3 assesses the engagement of the private sector and the quality of public-private dialogue (PPD) in a given country. In doing so, it recognises the importance of inclusive dialogue with the private sector for building a policy environment conducive
                                        to growth and sustainable development.
                                        <br><br> The indicator builds on tools developed by the World Bank, and its three modules combine globally-sourced quantitative scores and country-sourced qualitative information compiled through a multi-stakeholder
                                        dialogue process.
                                        <br><br> The indicator is structured around the three following modules:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Module 1 assesses the country’s enabling environment for engagement with the private sector and relies on globally-sourced data. The results for this module draw on country scores from a series of international
                                                indices, including the ‘Public Engagement’ index from the Open Budget Survey, as well as the ‘Voice and Accountability’, ‘Rule of Law’ and ‘Control of Corruption’ indices from the Worldwide Governance Indicators
                                                and the ‘Citizen Engagement in Rulemaking’ index.</li>
                                            <li>Module 2 assesses the country’s readiness for public-private dialogue. It relies on a qualitative questionnaire, answers to which were agreed through a country-level multi-stakeholder dialogue process led by
                                                the government, and engaging focal points from the private sector, development partners, trade unions, CSOs and other relevant stakeholders; </li>
                                            <li>Module 3 is designed as an optional component, and provides an in-depth assessment (case study) of the quality and organisational effectiveness of a given public-private platform in the country.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        The results displayed for this indicator (Module 2 only) are on a scale from 0 (weak) to 10 (strong). This indicator was measured for the first time as part of the 2016 monitoring round.

                                        Indicator 4 seeks to capture the timeliness, comprehensiveness and forward-looking nature of individual development partners’ electronic publication of information on co-operation resources. It measures transparency by considering three complementary
                                        measurements in parallel: the OECD-DAC’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/idsonline.htm">Creditor Reporting System</a> (CRS) and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/idsonline.htm">Forward-Spending Survey</a>                                        (FSS); and the <a target="_blank" href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/index.html">International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)</a>.
                                        <br><br> The <a href="http://www.oecd.org/development/effectiveness/49650173.pdf">Busan Partnership Agreement</a> mandated a ‘common standard’ for transparency, which was to be built on the three measurements. Following
                                        joint technical work between these bodies, however, it was clear that it was not possible to develop a singular common standard to assess transparency because the three measurements are designed to meet the needs
                                        of different audiences and are therefore not directly comparable in assessing development partners’ reporting performance.
                                        <br><br> To facilitate interpretation of the overall scores for these three transparency assessments, development partners are categorised on the same four-tiered scale: Excellent, Good, Fair and Needs Improvement.
                                        Nonetheless, each of the assessments has its own distinct <a target="_blank" href="http://effectivecooperation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3.-Global-Partnership-Transparency-Indicator-Methodological-Note.pdf">underlying methodology</a>,
                                        and therefore they are not directly comparable among themselves.

                            sector and delays in the in-year disbursements of scheduled funds can have serious implications for a government’s ability to implement development policies and strategies as planned.

                            <br><br> The forward spending plan must meet all of the following criteria in order to be included in the results:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Be made available by the development partner in written or electronic form;</li>

                                ‘Systematically tracked’ means that a tracking process is planned and regularly conducted. For instance, if the tracking of budgets allocations towards gender equality is officially planned and conducted annually by an identifiable or designated body,
                                it can be said that allocations for gender equality are systematically tracked.

                            Indicator 9a seeks to assess progressive strengthening of a country’s own systems. Well-performing country systems are essential to ensure that public expenditure for ambitious national plans translates into development results in the most effective and
                            sustainable manner.
                            <br><br> This indicator measures the proportion of participating countries moving up by at least half a point on the World Bank’s Quality of Budgetary and Financial Management Scale. It is based on the scores for the quality
                            of budgetary and financial management of the World Bank’s <a target="_blank" href="https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/CPIA">Country Policy and Institutional Assessment</a> (CPIA).
                            <br><br> Scores range from 1-6 in half-point increments; the higher the score, the more reliable the country’s budget and financial management system is considered to be.
                            <br><br> The CPIA assesses whether the country meets the following three criteria, which are equally weighted:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Existence of a comprehensive and credible budget, linked to policy priorities;</li>
                                <li>Effective financial management systems to ensure that the budget is implemented as intended in a controlled and predictable way; and</li>
                                <li>Timely and accurate accounting and financial reporting, including audited public accounts and effective arrangements for follow-up.</li>
                            </ul>
                            For the 2016 monitoring round, the Global Partnership monitoring framework drew on the most recent CPIA scores (2015). For the 2014 monitoring round, CPIA scores from 2012 were used.

                            Indicator 9b measures the proportion of development co-operation disbursed to the government using the country’s own financial management and procurement systems. This includes using the country’s own rules and procedures – versus those of the development
                            partner – for budget execution, financial reporting, auditing and procurement of goods and services.
                            <br><br> The Global Partnership measures the use of public and financial procurement systems as proxies for the broader use of national systems and institutions.

                            Indicator 10 measures the share of development assistance that is fully untied within a given country or by a development partner. Tied aid implies funding for which partners establish geographical restrictions as to where funds can be spent.
                            <br><br> Tying funding decreases the effective use of the funds and reduces the value-for-money of development co-operation. Tied aid also challenges the country’s ownership over purchasing decisions and deprives the country
                            of potential positive externalities in using development co-operation, such as using local suppliers.
                            <br><br> Aid is considered untied when the bilateral partner does not impose geographical restrictions on the use of the development co-operation funds.
                            <br><br> Data for this indicator was self-reported by development partners through the OECD-DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS).
